### About This Project
**Gameday Nashville** is an application that helps bring NFL football fans together to watch their favorite team on game day. The primary user of the application will be sports fans, the secondary user will be restaurant and bar owners or managers. When a user visits the site they will find more information about how to use the app and see a list of all available events or 'watch parties'. Once a user has registered for an account or used the log in feature, they will be able to search for a team and see all upcoming games and create a new event. Once the user has created an event, the event details will display on the home page for all site visitors to see and the ability to interact with the event (edit the details or delete the event) will become available on the My Events page.

The need for this app became clear to me when I moved to Nashville and no longer had pals, who shared my interest in Kansas City sports, to watch games with. According the the US Census Bureau, Nashville is one of the fastest growing metros in America with migrants coming from the north, east, south, and west. This application will also serve to welcome newcomers and help them find and connect with new pals.
